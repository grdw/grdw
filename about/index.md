### Projects

#### Solder — Backend for Integrations WeTransfer
A golang project that enabled asynchronous Transfers between various storage providers to-and-from WeTransfer. The first provider to be added was Dropbox.

#### MeTransfer — Core WeTransfer
Hackathon project I led in 2022 for which I won a prize. The idea here was to use locally available networks to transfer files between a single users' phone and laptop in order to save on storage costs. Roughly 28% of Transfers send at WeTransfer were transfers of a user to themselves. This was build in less than a week and roughly based on an article I wrote ["How to copy a file between devices?"](/2022/10/03/how-to-copy-a-file-between-devices.html) which was briefly featured on the front page of Hackernews in 2024. This project led to investigative work into WebRTC / ICE / STUN / TURN, and eventually to a proof of concept at the mobile team of WeTransfer.

#### Decommissioning the old download-server — Backend core WeTransfer
Assisting in turning off and replacing the old download-server which at the time had about ~500 req/s. Switched from Ruby to Golang.

#### RichUrls — Backend for the Collect product
A small service used to enrich links that are shared in a Collect board.

#### Spaceship — Backend for the Collect product
A backend for the Collect product at WeTransfer. I worked on this project for more than 2 years at WeTransfer. I helped to integrate the newly launched Android application. Furthermore, I introduced Operational Transform (OT) to help assist with syncing data across multiple users and multiple devices, saving tons of redundant syncing requests. I helped with onboarding Auth0, a new identity provider which was used across the organization.

#### ETLocal — Local energy transition platform
At Quintel Intelligence they needed a project to help municipalities and provinces to help with their more localized energy transition needs. This took the national energy model and scaled it down to the appropriate level.

#### Symbid / Gambitious — Online crowdfunding platform
Building new features, maintaining the full stack at Holder.
