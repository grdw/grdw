### Part 1
The navigation subsystem of my submarine is failing and there seems to be syntax errors on all lines of my input file. Each opening bracket of any kind `[({<` should have a matching closing bracket `])}>`. The first part is to find the corrupted lines, which are lines with false 'closing' brackets.

The first method I wrote is an input parser:

```rust
fn parse(input: &Vec<&str>) -> Vec<(Vec<char>, Vec<char>)> {
    let map = HashMap::from([
        ('}', '{'),
        (')', '('),
        ('>', '<'),
        (']', '['),
    ]);

    let mut result = vec![];

    for line in input {
        let mut opens = vec![];
        let mut closes = vec![];

        for ch in line.chars() {
            match ch {
                '[' | '(' | '{' | '<' => opens.push(ch),
                ']' | ')' | '}' | '>' => {
                    let opener = map.get(&ch).unwrap();
                    if opens.last().unwrap() == opener {
                        opens.pop();
                    } else {
                        closes.push(ch)
                    }
                },
                _ => panic!("Invalid syntax")
            }

        }

        result.push((opens, closes));
    }

    result
}
```

Nothing too fancy, it reads each line, then each char of each line and make two lists: one for all the opening characters and one for all the closing characters. There's a catch to the closing characters, each closing character checks the last value that was pushed in the opening characters list and drops it if is found. If it isn't found, we push the character to the closing characters list.

To determine the amount of points for the first mismatching bracket:

```rust
fn parse_navigation_subsystem(input: &Vec<&str>) -> u64 {
    let points = HashMap::from([
        (')', 3),
        (']', 57),
        ('}', 1197),
        ('>', 25137)
    ]);

    let mut subtotal = 0;
    let parsed = parse(input);

    for (_, closes) in parsed {
        if closes.len() > 0 {
            subtotal += points.get(&closes[0]).unwrap();
        }
    }

    subtotal
}
```

### Part 2
Because my initial `parse()`-method acts the way it does, part 2 is actually quite simple. I have to only check the amount of remaining opening brackets and do some basic calculation:

```rust
fn autocomplete_subsystem(input: &Vec<&str>) -> u64 {
    let mut scores = vec![];
    let points = HashMap::from([
        ('(', 1),
        ('[', 2),
        ('{', 3),
        ('<', 4)
    ]);

    let parsed = parse(input);

    for (opens, closes) in parsed {
        if !closes.is_empty() {
            continue;
        }

        let mut autocomplete_total = 0;

        for open in opens.iter().rev() {
            autocomplete_total *= 5;
            autocomplete_total += points.get(open).unwrap();
        }

        scores.push(autocomplete_total)
    }

    scores.sort();
    scores[(scores.len() / 2)]
}
```

Voilà, solved! ⭐️⭐️
