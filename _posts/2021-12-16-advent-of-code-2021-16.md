### Part 1
Feel free to read the puzzle text yourself, because it's quite the book to read. The input is a hexadecimal number, which needs to be converted to binary in a very specific way. The binary contains a packet, which itself contains many packets. The data-structure is: packets within packets within packets within a packet (did anybody say recursion?). The first part is to parse the entire hierarchy of the packet structure and sum all the version numbers (bits 0 till 3 of a packet).

Initially, I began by taking the hexadecimal string and turning it into a binary. According to the puzzle, each hexadecimal character needs to be transformed into a 4-bits binary:

```rust
let mut start = String::from("");

for b in bytes {
    if b < &11 { continue };
    let s = format!("{}", *b as char);
    let int = u64::from_str_radix(&s, 16).unwrap();
    let binary = format!("{:04b}", int);

    start.push_str(&binary);
}
```

Next up I started taking string slices, like such:

```rust
let version = &binary_string[0..3];
let type_id = &binary_string[3..6];
// etc.
```

However, this becomes very tedious when 11 or 15 bits have to be read consecutively. If only Rust had some sort of `StringIO`? It turns out it does, it is called `Cursor` in Rust. With `Cursor` I was able to parse the entire structure rather easily. First I defined a `read_ahead` method, which was able to move the cursor ahead a bunch of bytes, and turn said buffer into an integer (which is what needed to happen most of the reads):

```rust
fn read_ahead(cursor: &mut Cursor<String>, bytes: usize) -> u64 {
    let mut buf = vec![0; bytes];
    let _c = cursor.read_exact(&mut buf);
    let version = str::from_utf8(&buf).unwrap();
    u64::from_str_radix(&version, 2).unwrap()
}
```

Another little read-method I needed was one which could parse literal values, which are packets with `type_id` 4. Feel free to look up what that means in the original puzzle text, but here is how that functions:

```rust
fn read_literal_value(cursor: &mut Cursor<String>) -> u64 {
    let mut total = String::new();
    loop {
        let mut buf = vec![0; 5];
        let _c = cursor.read_exact(&mut buf);
        let version = str::from_utf8(&buf).unwrap();

        total.push_str(&version[1..5]);

        if &version[..1] == "0" {
            break;
        }
    }
    u64::from_str_radix(&total, 2).unwrap()
}
```

Next up I needed, a parse-method which can parse the full structure, with all its quirks and little edge-cases:

```rust
pub fn parse(cursor: &mut Cursor<String>, counter: &mut u64) {
    let version = read_ahead(cursor, 3);
    let type_id = read_ahead(cursor, 3);

    *counter += version;

    if type_id == 4 {
        let _value = read_literal_value(cursor);
    } else {
        let type_length_id = read_ahead(cursor, 1);

        if type_length_id == 0 {
            let total_length = read_ahead(cursor, 15);
            parse_with_read_limit(cursor, total_length, counter);
        } else if type_length_id == 1 {
            let number_of_packs = read_ahead(cursor, 11);
            parse_with_packet_limit(cursor, number_of_packs, counter);
        }
    }
}

fn parse_with_read_limit(
    cursor: &mut Cursor<String>,
    limit: u64,
    counter: &mut u64
) {
    let curr_poss = cursor.position();
    let limit = curr_poss + limit;

    while cursor.position() < limit {
        parse(cursor, counter);
    }
}

fn parse_with_packet_limit(
    cursor: &mut Cursor<String>,
    limit: u64,
    counter: &mut u64
) {
    let mut count = 0;

    while count < limit {
        parse(cursor, counter);
        count += 1;
    }
}
```

To successfully resolve part 1 of this adventure:

```rust
let bytes = display_string.as_bytes();
let mut cursor = bytes_to_bin(&bytes);
let mut counter = 0;
p1::parse(&mut cursor, &mut counter);
println!("The sum of version numbers is: {}", counter);
```

The first part was quite a lot of reading, but nothing too hard. I did learn how to use `Cursor` in Rust and how to deal with a thing I know as `StringIO` in Ruby.

### Part 2
This is where things get really, really juicy. It turns out that packets have `types`. In part 1 we already touched upon packets of type 4, which meant they were literal values, but in part 2 we get to learn what the others do. There are in total 8 types of operation packets (feel free to look up in the original puzzle text what each operation packet type is supposed to represent). The operation packets each execute a different operation on their sub-packets. The way to resolve this puzzle is as follows:

- Make a tree-structure of all the packets
- Recursively collapse each branch of operation-packets with literal value packets as direct descendants.

One little problem: I have to do this in Rust. Rust is one of the most memory-safe languages out there and will throw a tantrum - and rightfully so - when your code is not memory safe. To make a tree in Rust; I wasn't sure if I was ready for that one just yet, but I gave it a try. After some research online (and finding many copied articles of other articles, I found a tree structure that I could reasonably use):

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub enum Instruction {
    No,
    Number(u64),
    Op(u64)
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Node {
    children: Vec<Rc<RefCell<Node>>>,
    instruction: Instruction
}
```

The first trick is extending the code from part 1 and creating an entire tree out of it. The second trick is collapsing the subtrees. The way I collapsed the tree I'll explain next. Imagine you have just parsed your operation tree:

```
          9
        /
      + - 8
    /
max
    \
     * - 7
       \
         5
```

The first trick is to find a node whose children are all "leaf"-nodes (and therefor numbers). The first node in my example which follows this rule is the +-node (the other being the \*-node). To collapse this bit into a different tree, we need to parse it onto another tree. We can't edit the existing tree because we'd have to change the parent-node (`max`), to which we don't have access (thanks Rust). To visualize this process:

Step 1: Read the full tree we just parsed (incl. the root-node):

```
                 9
               /
             + - 8
           /
root - max
           \
            * - 7
              \
                5
```

Step 2: Create a new tree, and step by step add nodes to it (in order of depth) until you reach a node where the children are _all_ leafs. Execute the operation on those children as specified in the puzzle, and you'll be left with this:

```
After step 1:

root

After step 2:

root - max

After step 3:

             17
           /
root - max
           \
             35
```

Because there are no more nodes to loop over, the loop stops. Obviously, we have to repeat this cycle until we are left with `root - value`. That `value` is going to be the answer to part 2.

There's a bit too much code to reasonably copy/paste around, so feel free to check the GitHub-link down below. I learned a lot about trees in Rust and how to collapse them onto different trees.

This was the hardest, yet most enjoyable Advent of code puzzle I encountered so far (I'm not looking at you Day 6). I claimed this star gladly.
