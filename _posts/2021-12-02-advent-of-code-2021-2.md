**Part 1**
I am given a file called `input` in which there is a list of 1000 instructions in the format of: `forward 1, down 1, up 6` etc. The submarine can move forward, up or down. The depth increases or decreases depending on their related up or down instructions. The position can only increase with a forward instruction. What is the product of the final depth times the final position, after following all the instructions?

```rust
fn move_submarine(coords: &Vec<&str>) -> u32 {
    let mut start = (0, 0);

    for coord in coords {
        let d: Vec<&str> = coord.split(" ").collect();
        let x: u32 = d[1].parse().unwrap();
        match d[0] {
            "forward" => start.0 += x,
            "down" => start.1 += x,
            "up" => start.1 -= x,
            _ => panic!("invalid direction")
        }
    }

    start.0 * start.1
}

#[test]
fn test_movement() {
    let final_pos = move_submarine(
        &vec![
            "forward 5",
            "down 5",
            "forward 8",
            "up 3",
            "down 8",
            "forward 2"
        ]
    );

    assert_eq!(final_pos, 150)
}
```

**Part 2**
The second part of the question introduces a third variable alongside `depth` and `position`, a thing called `aim`. The aim increases or decreases depending on their related up or down instructions. The position increases with a forward instruction, however the depth now also increases by the `aim` times the forward motion. What is the product of the final depth and the final position?

```rust
fn move_submarine(coords: &Vec<&str>) -> u32 {
    let mut depth = 0;
    let mut position = 0;
    let mut aim = 0;

    for coord in coords {
        let d: Vec<&str> = coord.split(" ").collect();
        let x: u32 = d[1].parse().unwrap();

        match d[0] {
            "forward" => {
                position += x;
                depth += aim * x;
            },
            "down" => aim += x,
            "up" => aim -= x,
            _ => panic!("invalid direction")
        }
    }

    depth * position
}
```

Nothing too hard for day 2, and so I gained another two stars ⭐️⭐️.
