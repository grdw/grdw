**Part 1**
I am given a file called `input` in which there is a list of 2000 numbers, which represent depth readings to a submarine sonar system. Part 1 of the puzzle asks how many times the depth increases. This is fairly simple in Rust:

```rust
fn depth_increases(depths: &Vec<u16>) -> usize {
    (0..depths.len() - 1)
        .filter(|&i| depths[i + 1] > depths[i])
        .count()
}
```

**Part 2**
The second part is the same question, but asking which three-measurement sliding window is larger than the next; technically asking which consecutive sum of three measurements is larger. This can be solved like this:

```rust
fn sliding_depth_increases(depths: &Vec<u16>) -> usize {
    let group_size = 3;

    (0..depths.len() - group_size)
        .filter(|&i| {
            let sum: u16 = depths[i..i + 3].iter().sum();
            let next_sum: u16 = depths[i + 1..i + 4].iter().sum();

            next_sum > sum
        }).count()
}
```

Nothing too hard for day 1, and so I gained two stars ⭐️⭐️.
