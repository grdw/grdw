### Part 1
I finally get out of the caves with my submarine, but I have to check which route would involve the least amount of risk getting out of the caves. We get a grid of points like such:

```
1163751742
1381373672
2136511328
3694931569
7463417111
1319128137
1359912421
3125421639
1293138521
2311944581
```

My submarine has to traverse from the top-left to the bottom-right, while taking the least amount of risk. This is when the actual Dijkstra algorithm comes in to play, instead of when I mentioned it earlier in [Day 12](/2021/12/12/advent-of-code-2021-12.html). One of the ingredients for Dijkstra is a priority queue. In Rust I know that a lot of people use a `BinaryHeap` for this. The fun thing is that the documentation for `BinaryHeap` contains a Dijkstra implementation, so I simply used that one [1]. The code for part 1, went something like this:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::collections::BinaryHeap;

type Grid = Vec<Vec<Node>>;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Node(usize, usize);

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Edge(usize, usize);
type Edges = Vec<Vec<Edge>>;

fn main() {
    let display_string = fs::read_to_string("input")
                            .unwrap_or("".to_string());

    let risk = risk_level(&display_string, 0, 9999);
    println!("The risk level is: {:?}", risk);
}

fn to_grid(input: &str) -> Grid {
    let mut grid: Grid = vec![];
    let mut id = 0;

    for line in input.split_terminator("\n") {
        let mut points = vec![];

        for cha in line.chars() {
            let value = cha.to_digit(10).unwrap() as usize;
            points.push(Node(id, value));
            id += 1;
        }

        grid.push(points);
    }

    grid
}

fn to_graph(input: &str) -> Edges {
    let grid = to_grid(input);
    let size = grid.len();

    let mut edges: Edges = vec![vec![]; size.pow(2)];

    for y in 0..size {
        for x in 0..size {
            let current = &grid[y][x];

            if let Some(row) = grid.get(y + 1) {
                edges[current.0].push(Edge(
                    row[x].0,
                    (current.1 + row[x].1) as usize
                ));
            }

            if let Some(cell) = grid[y].get(x + 1) {
                edges[current.0].push(Edge(
                    cell.0,
                    (current.1 + cell.1) as usize
                ));
            }
        }
    }

    edges
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
struct State {
    cost: usize,
    position: usize,
}

impl Ord for State {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
        other.cost.cmp(&self.cost)
            .then_with(|| self.position.cmp(&other.position))
    }
}

impl PartialOrd for State {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}

fn risk_level(input: &str, start: usize, goal: usize) -> Option<usize> {
    let edges = to_graph(input);
    let mut dist: Vec<_> = vec![usize::MAX; edges.len()];
    let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();

    dist[start] = 0;
    heap.push(State { cost: 0, position: start });

    while let Some(State { cost, position }) = heap.pop() {
        if position == goal { return Some(cost / 2); }
        if cost > dist[position] { continue; }

        for edge in &edges[position] {
            let next = State { cost: cost + edge.1, position: edge.0 };

            if next.cost < dist[next.position] {
                heap.push(next);

                dist[next.position] = next.cost;
            }
        }
    }

    None
}
```

For some stupid reason I had to divide the final cost by 2, and I didn't know why exactly. It got me to the right answer, but it is actually wrong to do so. Which brings me to part 2:

### Part 2
In part 2 I found out I never had to do the divide by 2, because I was costing my edges with "too much". I should've just used the cost of the adjacent node. After executing that code, the answer to part 1 had an "off by one" error, which was caused by the fact that in my code I wasn't taking into account that you should include edges from the left and top of the current node. After those were included, the answer was resolved.

The only trick was increasing the graph to 5 times its original size and executing the same algorithm again. I've done it a bit more manual than I've seen others do it, but it works.
