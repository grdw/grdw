**Part 1**
The puzzle input this time around is a list of numbers. Each number represent a crab and a certain amount of fuel. The goal is to find the cheapest move all the crabs can make while sparing the most fuel. The first solution is going to be a simple one, knowing that for part 2 I probably need to do something smarter. The first simple version:

```rust
fn cheapest_crab_move(crabs: Vec<isize>) -> isize {
    let mut min_fuel = isize::MAX;
    let mut lowest_move = -1;
    let max = crabs.iter().max().unwrap();

    for m in 0..*max {
        let sum_fuel: isize = crabs
            .iter()
            .map(|n| (n - m).abs())
            .fold(0, |acc, b| acc + b);

        if sum_fuel < min_fuel {
            min_fuel = sum_fuel;
            lowest_move = m;
        }
    }

    lowest_move
}


#[test]
fn test_cheapest_move() {
    let moves = vec![16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14];

    assert_eq!(cheapest_crab_move(moves), 2);
}
```

For part 1 the aforementioned code, returns 307. However, that seems to be the incorrect answer. I check all positions between 0 and 1931 (the highest number in the input). All the example values are correct (I get 41 fuel for position 1, 39 for position 3 and 71 for position 10). Perhaps there are two values that return 307? After some reading, the actual question dictates: "How much _fuel_ does it take?", which is a different question all together. After tweaking the code slightly and getting rid of `lowest_move`, I get the correct answer.

**Part 2**
Apparently I didn't do the actual crab engineering correctly, and I need to take into account that each horizontal step, increments the fuel consumption by 1. I've written a very expensive method:

```rust
fn cheapest_crab_move_with_tax(crabs: &Vec<isize>) -> isize {
    let mut min_fuel = isize::MAX;
    let max = crabs.iter().max().unwrap();

    for m in 0..*max {
        let sum_fuel: isize = crabs
            .iter()
            .map(|n| {
                let steps = (n - m).abs();
                (1..=steps).sum::<isize>()
            })
            .fold(0, |acc, b| acc + b);

        if sum_fuel < min_fuel {
            min_fuel = sum_fuel;
        }
    }

    min_fuel
}


#[test]
fn test_cheapest_move_with_tax() {
    let moves = vec![16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14];

    assert_eq!(cheapest_crab_move_with_tax(moves), 168);
}
```

Voilà! Solved, and another two stars added. ⭐️⭐️

**Improvements**
To make part 2 quite a lot faster, you can calculate the 'tax rates' before hand:

```rust
let mut min_fuel = isize::MAX;
let mut tax_rates = vec![0, 1];
let max = crabs.iter().max().unwrap();

for t in 2..=*max {
    tax_rates.push((1..=t).sum::<isize>());
}

for m in 0..*max {
    let sum_fuel: isize = crabs
        .iter()
        .map(|n| tax_rates[(n - m).abs() as usize])
        .fold(0, |acc, b| acc + b);

    if sum_fuel < min_fuel {
        min_fuel = sum_fuel;
    }
}

min_fuel
```

Another improvement is to make use of the `min()` method to make the code a bit more condensed:

```rust
let mut tax_rates = vec![0, 1];
let max = crabs.iter().max().unwrap();

for t in 2..=*max {
    tax_rates.push((1..=t).sum::<isize>());
}

(0..*max)
    .map(|m|
        crabs
            .iter()
            .map(|n| tax_rates[(n - m).abs() as usize])
            .fold(0, |acc, b| acc + b))
    .min().unwrap()
```
