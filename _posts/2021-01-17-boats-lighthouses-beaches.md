Other pictures I took in Hoorn and surrounding areas.

This photo is in color but I like it because it was an accident. I used the wrong lighting and it ended up with this ominous blue hue.

All these images are downscaled to 800px by Ypx to make them load on the web just a bit faster. If you need the full image, please [send me an email](/about) and I can send it to you. All these images were created with a Nikon D90 digital camera and altered to black and white with Gimp + Dark table.
