title: "Advent of code 2021: Day 6"
problem_type: aoc2021
problem: 6
complexity: 3
---

**Part 1**
The puzzle gives you an input file containing a bunch of numbers. Each number represents a single lantern fish, where the number itself represent the amount of days before a new lantern fish is born from said lantern fish. Each 7 days a new lantern fish is born, however first-born lantern fishes take 9 days to produce their first new lantern fish.

The first, kind of brain-dead, method is this:

```rust
fn immaculate_conception(mut lantern_fish: Vec<i16>, days: i16) -> u128 {
    for _ in 0..days {
        for i in 0..lantern_fish.len() {
            if lantern_fish[i] == 0 {
                lantern_fish[i] = 6;
                lantern_fish.push(8);
            } else {
                lantern_fish[i] -= 1;
            }
        }
    }

    lantern_fish.len() as u128
}

#[test]
fn test_lantern_fish() {
    let mut lantern_fish = vec![3, 4, 3, 1, 2];
    let count = immaculate_conception(lantern_fish.clone(), 18);
    assert_eq!(count, 26);

    let count = immaculate_conception(lantern_fish.clone(), 80);
    assert_eq!(count, 5934);
}
```

Gained one star!

**Part 2**
Here is where things get really tricky, because the puzzle asks how many fishes there will be after 256 days. The problem with 256 is that the population growth will be too much to handle reasonably in a single array. The array will grow insanely large, grinding the whole process to a halt.

I've been looking around to see if we can solve it with some basic math, but I think we need some of the more advanced chapters of math, to solve this one. However, here are my thoughts:

Assume we have 1 fish who takes 7 days (6) before there's new offspring. Assume that each new offspring also takes 7 days the first time around, instead of the 9 days (I know, that's not the case, but let's just make the problem smaller). If that's the case we'd say: "each 7 days the population doubles". If we let this one lantern fish swim about for 30 days, we'd assume that this lantern fish ends up with 30 / 7 = 4, 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 lantern fishes.

If the lantern fish only takes 2 days (1) before there's new offspring, the lantern fish would take (30 - 2) = 28, 28 / 7 = 4, 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 lantern fishes. Now to tackle the 9 day limit for the first borns:

**Brain fart 1: Determining the growth factor**
I think the question I need to answer is: "How much does the population increase over N days?". When we remove the 9 day contraint for newborns, and assume N = 30, what would the growth factor look like?

```
Assume we have 1 fish

0) 6 (Start at 6)
-----------------
1) 5
2) 4
3) 3
4) 2
5) 1
6) 0
7) 6 (x2, or (1 + 100 / 100))
8) 5
9) 4
10) 3
11) 2
12) 1
13) 0
14) 6 (x2, or (1 + 100 / 100))
15) 5
16) 4
17) 3
18) 2
19) 1
20) 0
21) 6 (x2, or (1 + 100 / 100))
22) 5
23) 4
24) 3
25) 2
26) 1
27) 0
28) 6 (x2, or (1 + 100 / 100))
29) 5
30) 4
```

Reading up on growth factors [1] I guess to calculate what's going on here:

```
Every 7 days we double are population, so 100%.
The growth factor is:

1 + (100 / 100) = 2

The growth factor per day is 2^(1/7) = 1.104089

1.104089^30 = 19.504
1.104089^28 = 15.999
```

We end up with 16 fishes, not 19 fishes. The reason why this is a bit broken is because this also counts how many non-completed fishes are formed within the other fishes, which adds up as a complete lanturn fish. This shouldn't happen but with some integer division, we can work around this problem, namely by doing (30 / 7) x 7.

This still only resolves the problem, without taking into account the initial 9 days. This brain fart will bring me nowhere.

**Brain fart 2: counting with a vector**
What if we could do something like this:

```rust
let lantern_fish = vec![3, 4, 3, 1, 2];
let mut fish_counts = vec![1; lantern_fish.len()];

// do some magic
```

We know that after 3 days I gain a fish for `lanter_fish[0]`. To do the rest we do something like this:

```rust
for i in 0..lantern_fish.len() {
    if days > lantern_fish[i] {
        fish_counts[i] += 1; // Initial cycle

        let d_left = days - lantern_fish[i];
        println!("{}", d_left);
    }
}

// d_left prints 15,14,15,17,16
```

The first time, let's ignore the 9 rule, and just stick to the 7 rule. So our fishes double each 7th day.

... yeah, this is also going nowhere.

Time to watch match videos!

The growth rate formula is:

```
y = a * (1 + x)^r
```

If we got a lantern fish every 7 days (ignoring the 9 rule we'd get):

```
256 / 7 = 36.57
y = 1 * (1 + 2)^36
y = 1.50004*10^17
```

What we cannot do here is `(256 - 9) / 7` because that just doesn't feel right.
