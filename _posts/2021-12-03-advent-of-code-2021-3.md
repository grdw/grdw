### Part 1
I am given a file called `input` in which there is a list of 1000 binary instructions which represent a diagnostic report to the submarine. The first part is to figure out the `gamma_rate` and the `epsilon_rate`. To determine the `gamma_rate` you'd have to take all the numbers vertically and check if it has more 1's than 0's, if it does the first bit is a 1 if it doesn't, it is a 0. The epsilon rate is determined by taking the least common bit value. Repeat until you're left with 2 n-digit binaries; multiply both binaries in the base10 number system, and you'll get your answer.

The way I approached this is by first creating a method, which would count the amount of times, I vertically would encounter a '1', like such:

```rust
fn totals(binaries: &Vec<&str>) -> Vec<usize> {
    let len = binaries[0].len();
    let mut total_ones = vec![0; len];

    for bin in binaries {
        for i in 0..len {
            let c = bin.chars().nth(i);

            if c == Some('1') {
                total_ones[i] += 1;
            }
        }
    }

    total_ones
}
```

In the first example this returns: `[7, 5, 8, 7, 5]`. To get the actual rates, I test if the amount of '1's I encounter are higher than the amount of binary readings I have divided by 2 (if more than half are 1's). If they are, I add `2_u32.pow(n)` to `gamma_rate`, if they aren't, I add the amount to `epsilon_rate`. In the end, I multiply both digits.

```rust
fn binary_diagnostic(binaries: &Vec<&str>) -> u32 {
    let threshold = binaries.len() / 2;
    let total_ones = totals(binaries);

    let mut gamma_rate = 0;
    let mut epsilon_rate = 0;

    for (i, t) in total_ones.iter().enumerate() {
        let n = 2_u32.pow((total_ones.len() - 1 - i) as u32);

        if *t > threshold {
            gamma_rate += n;
        } else {
            epsilon_rate += n;
        }
    }

    gamma_rate * epsilon_rate
}
```

### Part 2
The second part is where things get a bit (pun intended) more tricky. The puzzle asks to calculate the life support rating, which is obtainable from the diagnostics report by finding the oxygen generator rating and the CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber rating. The way to determine both these values is as follows:

```
00100
11110
10110
10111
10101
01111
00111
11100
10000
11001
00010
01010
```

With the example above; for the oxygen generator rating; the idea is to take all vertical bits and see that there are more 1's than 0's. Filter out all the digits that don't start with a '1'. This will result in the list:

```
11110
10110
10111
10101
11100
10000
11001
```

In the next row there are more 0's than 1's; so the 0's persist:

```
10110
10111
10101
10000
```

And so on. In the end, you should be left with one digit. If a tie is formed; meaning there are an equal amount of 0's and 1's, we can say that the concluding binary (or binaries) should be the one which has a '1' at that position.

The CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber rating is obtained; and you guessed it; the other way around. You take the least common bits, until one row remains. If a tie is formed, you pick the binary (or binaries) which have a '0' at that position.

There are multiple ways of achieving this, an expensive way - which is what I currently have - and a potentially cheaper way, which I'll list under improvements. The current expensive way goes something like this:

```rust
fn life_support_rating(binaries: &Vec<&str>) -> u32 {
    let oxygen_rating = binary_filter(&binaries, '1');
    let co2_scrubber_rating = binary_filter(&binaries, '0');

    oxygen_rating * co2_scrubber_rating
}

fn binary_filter(binaries: &Vec<&str>, search: char) -> u32 {
    let mut filter = binaries.clone();

    let reverse = if search >= '1' {
                      '0'
                  } else {
                      '1'
                  };

    for i in 0..binaries[0].len() {
        let threshold = ((filter.len() as f32) * 5.0) as usize;
        let total_ones = totals(&filter);

        filter = filter
            .iter()
            .filter(|&&n| {
                let total = total_ones[i] * 10;
                let bit = if total >= threshold {
                              search
                          } else {
                              reverse
                          };

                n.chars().nth(i) == Some(bit)
            })
            .map(|n| *n)
            .collect();

        if filter.len() == 1 {
            break;
        }
    }

    u32::from_str_radix(filter[0], 2).unwrap()
}
```

We take the original binaries, clone them, and keep on filtering till there's only a single row left in the filter. That's the one we parse as a `u32`, and it will correctly give you the answer. The downside of this approach is that for each filtering, I recalculate the total number of '1's that are in the list of binaries. This is obviously a bit redundant, and I believe this can be done a bit cheaper. Regardless, I gained another two stars ⭐️⭐️.

PS: The threshold is multiplied by 5.0 (10.0 / 2.0) to combat situations where an uneven amount of binaries retain in the group. If I didn't do this, the threshold sometimes incorrectly equaled to the total amount of '1's. This obviously caused incorrect results.

### Improvements
Firstly, I refactored the original method by using Rust's `retain()` method. I also made `search` an array of 2 characters, the one to look for and the reverse. There might be something smarter I can do here, but for now this seems okay. The refactored method looks like this:

```rust
fn binary_filter(binaries: &Vec<&str>, search: &[char]) -> u32 {
    let mut bins = binaries.clone();
    let mut j = 0;

    while bins.len() > 1 {
        let total_ones = totals(&bins);
        let threshold = (bins.len() as f32 * 5.0) as usize;

        bins.retain(|&bin| {
            let bit = if total_ones[j] * 10 >= threshold {
                search[1]
            } else {
                search[0]
            };

            bin.chars().nth(j) == Some(bit)
        });

        j += 1
    }

    u32::from_str_radix(bins[0], 2).unwrap()
}
```

This is a lot cleaner than it was before. I can also get rid of `total`; because it currently counts the '1's for each vertical row. However, we're only interested in the amount of '1's at position `j`. With some filter magic `total_ones` can also be written as such:

```rust
let total_ones = bins
    .iter()
    .filter(|&&b| b.chars().nth(j) == Some('1'))
    .count();
```

I don't think it can be more optimized than this. The performance is already pretty great, especially because it only has to go over 1000 strings, which is not that many.
