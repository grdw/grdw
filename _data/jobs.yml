  projects:
    - name: MeTransfer — Core WeTransfer
      description: Hackathon project I led in 2022 for which I won a prize. The idea here was to use locally available networks to transfer files between a single users' phone and laptop in order to save on storage costs. Roughly 28% of Transfers send at WeTransfer were transfers of a user to themselves. This was build in less than a week and roughly based on an article I wrote <a href="/2022/10/03/how-to-copy-a-file-between-devices.html">"How to copy a file between devices?"</a> which was briefly featured on the front page of Hackernews in 2024. This project led to investigative work into WebRTC / ICE / STUN / TURN, and eventually to a proof of concept at the mobile team of WeTransfer.

    - name: Spaceship — Backend for the Collect product
      description: >
        A backend for the Collect product at WeTransfer. I worked on this project for more than 2 years at WeTransfer. I helped to integrate the newly launched Android application. Furthermore, I introduced Operational Transform (OT) to help assist with syncing data across multiple users and multiple devices, saving tons of redundant syncing requests. I helped with onboarding Auth0, a new identity provider which was used across the organization.
